<h2 class ="headTwo">About me</h2>

<div class = "aboutMe">
  <p>I have personally been active in treating and removing Bush Honeysuckle for the past 4 years.
      I've done this by volunteering with a conservation group, and now working with a Native Landscape company.
      I've quickly realized that this specific invasive species has made home in most urban and natural areas.
      Even though it will take several years to push it back to a acceptable level, it is still worth the fight.
      Educating the public about this shrub is critical to being able to knock it down.
      Invasive species will always be around but if we don't do anything about it, they will push out and kill our native species.
      This could be very detrimental to our ecosystem.
